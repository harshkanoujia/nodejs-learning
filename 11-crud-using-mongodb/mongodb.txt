What is MongoDB?
As we already explain that, MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database system that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance. 
Unlike standard relational databases, MongoDB stores data in a JSON document structure form. This makes it easy to operate with dynamic and unstructured 
data and MongoDB is an open-source and cross-platform database System. For a complete guide on how to integrate MongoDB with Node.js in full-stack 
development, the Full Stack Development with Node JS course covers everything from setting up MongoDB to managing data in real-world projects.

~Database:
-Database is a container for collections.
-Each database gets its own set of files.
-A single MongoDB server can has multiple databases.

~Collection:
-Collection is a group of documents.
-Collection is equivalent to RDBMS table.
-A collection consist inside a single database.
-Collections do not enforce a schema.
-A Collection can have different fields within a Documents.

Why Use MongoDB?
Document Oriented Storage − Data is stored in the form of JSON documents.

-Index on any attribute: Indexing in MongoDB allows for faster data retrieval by creating a searchable structure on selected attributes, optimizing query performance.
-Replication and high availability: MongoDB’s replica sets ensure data redundancy by maintaining multiple copies of the data, providing fault tolerance and continuous availability even in case of server failures.
-Auto-Sharding: Auto-sharding in MongoDB automatically distributes data across multiple servers, enabling horizontal scaling and efficient handling of large datasets.
-Big Data and Real-time Application: When dealing with massive datasets or applications requiring real-time data updates, MongoDB’s flexibility and scalability prove advantageous.
-Rich queries: MongoDB supports complex queries with a variety of operators, allowing you to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data in a flexible and powerful manner.
-Fast in-place updates: MongoDB efficiently updates documents directly in their place, minimizing data movement and reducing write overhead.
-Professional support by MongoDB: MongoDB offers expert technical support and resources to help users with any issues or challenges they may encounter during their database operations.
-Internet of Things (IoT) Applications: Storing and analyzing sensor data with its diverse formats often aligns well with MongoDB’s document structure.
